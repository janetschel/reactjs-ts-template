# ReactJS Typescript template

This repo serves as a *bare* blueprint for ReactJS projects based on Typescript.

For my likings `npx create-react- app . --template typescript` creates way too much unnecessary files which take ages to delete.  
This repo can be cloned with the bare flag and used for easy project setup.

## How to bare clone this repo without forking it

### Option 1

1. `$ git clone --bare https://github.com/janetschel/reactjs-ts-template.git`

2. `$ cd reactjs-ts-template.git`

3. `$ git push --mirror https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git`

4. You can now delete the repo folder which was created in step 1 and work with your repo

### Option 2

Just use this button: (not this one, it is located where you would normally clone the code)

and create your own repository right here on GitHub with this file structure as a template.
